This project works on an imbalanced dataset and tries to fix the class imbalance using undersampling (Cluster Centroids) and oversampling (SMOTE).
After balancing the data, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree models are trained and evaluated.
The project shows that accuracy alone is not enough and metrics like F1-score and AUROC are better for imbalanced data.
